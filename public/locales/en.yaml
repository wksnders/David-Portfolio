AboutMeSectionTitle: "About Me"
AboutMeSectionBody1: "International Communications Consultant—helping Koreans and their institutions communicate with global audiences for over 25 years." 
AboutMeSectionBody2: "I engineer clear, accurate and effective messaging, with a proven track record that includes work for the Republic of Korea’s last three presidents as a Korean government employee and a freelancer. "
AboutMeSectionBody3: "How I got here: In the 1990s, while teaching English to college students, factory workers, executives and officials, I listened to what they said, how they said it and wrote a book that identified the underlying linguistic and cultural differences behind the most common miscommunication. What my students said about their lives and country fascinated me, so I began to focus on writing and editing Korea-related content in the 2000s. This sparked a deeper interest that led to an M.A. in East Asian Studies. Through this lived experience and academic study, I’ve acquired a nuanced understanding of Korea's history, business culture and social dynamics."
