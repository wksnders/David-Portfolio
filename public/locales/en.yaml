AboutMeSectionTitle: "About Me"
AboutMeSectionBody1: "International Communications Consultant—helping Koreans and their institutions communicate with global audiences for over 25 years." 
AboutMeSectionBody2: "I engineer clear, accurate and effective messaging, with a proven track record that includes work for the Republic of Korea’s last three presidents as a Korean government employee and a freelancer. "
AboutMeSectionBody3: "How I got here: In the 1990s, while teaching English to college students, factory workers, executives and officials, I listened to what they said, how they said it and wrote a book that identified the underlying linguistic and cultural differences behind the most common miscommunication. What my students said about their lives and country fascinated me, so I began to focus on writing and editing Korea-related content in the 2000s. This sparked a deeper interest that led to an M.A. in East Asian Studies. Through this lived experience and academic study, I’ve acquired a nuanced understanding of Korea's history, business culture and social dynamics."

In fact, there were cases where translations originally done by another translation team—which had received negative feedback—were completely reworked by David and me from scratch, eventually resulting in deliverables that fully satisfied the client. When we work together, we devote particular effort to preserving the nuances of the original text while maintaining natural and idiomatic English expression.
